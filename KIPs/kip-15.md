## Summary

Based on forum discussions, the Kyber community is proposing that the following projects be included in the `Rainmaker` Joint Liquidity Mining program:

1. Creator chain on Ethereum, for [CTR-ETH](https://gov.kyber.org/t/creator-ctr-joint-liquidity-mining-proposal-23/309/29)

2. xToken on Ethereum, for [XTK-ETH](https://gov.kyber.org/t/joint-liquidity-mining-w-xtoken-on-kyberdmm/355)

3. xDollar on Polygon in 2 phases, for [xUSD-USDC](https://gov.kyber.org/t/joint-liquidity-mining-with-xdollar-polygon-on-kyberdmm/379)

4. Step Hero on BSC, for the [HERO token](https://gov.kyber.org/t/stephero-hero-joint-liquidity-mining-on-kyberdmm/397 )
 

## Creator Chain

### Project Introduction

Creator is a Blockchain-as-a-Service (BaaS) project that provides No Code Smart Contract, Low Code DApp and other services to empower the blockchain economy.
CTR token is an ERC-20 token. CTR holders can swap ERC-20 CTR tokens for native CTR coins at the ratio of 1 to 1. CTR token shall be used to pay for BaaS infrastructure, transactions, to buy NFT of creation products, etc.

### Motivation and Key Details

Creator is proposing a joint liquidity mining program with Kyber to help improve liquidity for the CTR token on KyberDMM protocol.

Creator is an ideal candidate for Rainmaker Liquidity Mining on KyberDMM. The project has attracted attention from lots of valuable VCs, such as Master Ventures, Kardia Ventures, Exnetwork Capital, etc. Apart from having the IDO launch on Ignition - PAID network, Creator also receives the support and advisory from Kyle Chasse - Founder of Master Ventures and backed by VMO Group - one of the top 10 IT companies in Vietnam.

At the same time, the project is supported by crypto influencers such as Crypto Villa, tehMoonWalkeR, etc with many activities ongoing. Creator has over 10,000 members in their global telegram channel and the same number of followers on twitter. With KyberDMM, Creator believes that CTR holders also become KyberDMM users, boosting the profit of both sides.

During the campaign period, liquidity providers who add liquidity (deposit tokens) on the eligible CTR-ETH pools will receive LP tokens that can be staked on the Yield page for additional CTR and KNC token rewards. As part of the campaign launch, there will also be joint marketing efforts with Kyber Network.

Creator will provide the minimum requirement of $90,000 worth of liquidity on a new amplified CTR-ETH pool on KyberDMM. Together with requested KNC rewards, total incentives exceed the minimum requirement of $90,000.

| KNC requested | Project contribution | Token pair | Vesting Schedule |Campaign duration|
|---------------|----------------------|------------|------------------|-----------------|
| $30,000       |$90,000               |CTR/ETH     |14 Days           |1 Month          |


## xToken

### Project Introduction

xToken is a DeFi protocol that wraps complicated staking and liquidity strategies into convenient and composable set-and-forget ERC20 tokens. xTokens are free-floating ERC20s that can be sent from wallet to wallet, added to liquidity pools and pledged as collateral for loans. They save users time and money, and they distill intricate token mechanics into simple buy-and-hold strategies while providing an opinionated governance option for users.

### Motivation and Key Details

xToken is proposing a joint liquidity mining program with Kyber to help improve liquidity for XTK while driving volume and xToken users to the KyberDMM exchange.

During the program, liquidity providers who deposit XTK and ETH into the eligible pool will receive LP tokens that can be staked on the Yield page for additional XTK and KNC rewards. As part of the program, xToken will work jointly with Kyber to market the pools to their respective communities, and new members. On top of the KNC liquidity incentives, Kyber will help with PR and marketing activities for this joint mining campaign - offering additional KNC rewards.

As a longstanding partner with Kyber, xToken makes a strong candidate for the Rainmaker Liquidity Mining program. As Kyber staking ramps back up with the new and improved KNC token model, xKNC will once again be an active contributor to KyberDAO.

Although the incentivized pool will be an XTK-ETH pool, we believe that a rewards program would serve to strengthen the relationship between our communities while increasing participation in Kyber staking via greater visibility for xKNC’s set-and-forget model. This will ultimately drive more KNC to be staked and participating in KyberDAO.

The core xToken team is a reputable, non-anonymous group of engineers and analysts who have shown resilience building over multiple DeFi cycles. xToken has an ambitious roadmap and has been on a torrid development schedule, with TVL increasing significantly in the past month alone.


| KNC requested | Project contribution | Token pair | Vesting Schedule | Campaign duration |
|---------------|----------------------|------------|------------------|------------------ |
|$100,000       |$200,000              |XTK/ETH     |14 Days           |8 weeks            |


## xDollar

### Project Introduction

xDollar is an interest-free stablecoin lending platform that any users can borrow non-custodial stablecoin, xUSD against their crypto assets on Polygon with a minimum collateral ratio of only 110%.
- vision is to become the next-generation multi-collateral chain agnostic stablecoin.
- mission is to democratize the store value of crypto assets on all chains and make cross-chain DeFI accessible to 1 billion users by 2030.

### Motivation and Key Details

xDollar is proposing a joint liquidity mining program with Kyber to help improve liquidity for the xUSD, a non-custodial stablecoin on KyberDMM protocol.
During the campaign period, liquidity providers who add liquidity (deposit tokens) on the eligible xUSD-USDC pool will receive LP tokens that can be staked on the Yield page for additional XDO and KNC token rewards. As part of the campaign launch, there will also be joint marketing efforts with Kyber Network.

**Additional Marketing Idea:**
xDollar is a true fan of POAP and has issued a few cool POAP to the community. The POAP campaign has been well received to boost project exposure and community growth. Therefore, xDollar proposes to launch a special POAP for Kyber. Top 420 xUSD-DAI LP users can claim an exclusive xPartner Kyber POAP after the end of yield farming period. And those 420 xPartner Kyber POAP are eligible for a POAP raffle which awards 42 lucky supporters with a fixed KNC and XDO reward which happens one/two weeks after the yield farming is over.

Here are a few reasons why xDollar is an ideal candidate for Rainmaker Liquidity Mining on KyberDMM.

First, xDollar is the first DeFI project on Polygon to integrate KyberDMM. xDollar is adventurous in nature to explore innovative projects like Kyber and works best for the xDollar community. As the first DeFI project on Polygon, xDollar integrated KyberDMM one month ago hence many xDollar users are also indirect KyberDMM users. Please read our medium post about Kyber DMM pool launching.

Our xDollar Research (XDOR) is also undergoing liquidity research by comparing KyberDMM vs other AMM where we launched incentive yield farms a month ago. Thanks to KyberDMM’s capital efficiency, xDollar users have benefited from the lower fee, lower price slippage, and high trading volume on KyberDMM. Since then, there has been high volume for the xUSD token for the past 30 days as seen on Kyber DMM statistics here. xUSD-DAI LP pairs have been ranked top seven pairs on KyberDMM even without the official KNC liquidity mining program.

Second, xDollar as a stablecoin lending DeFI lego has grown gradually to keep innovating the platform and growing the community which is aligned with Kyber’s vision. The xUSD product has been widely used by hundreds of users and has been audited by coinspect as well as ongoing audit by Certik on our xDollar V2 product. There are over 23,000 followers across the xDollar communities (twitter, discord, and telegram) and many are liquidity providers of KyberDMM. Furthermore, xDollar is not alone in the universe while connecting stars with other cross-chain projects to form a xCHAIN DeFI alliance, the first DeFI alliance focusing on cross-chain vision to make DeFI accessible to 1 billion users by 2025. We are confident that both xDollar and Kyber are benefiting from this xCHAIN alliance by doing a series of co-marketing, co-community and co-partnership.

Third, xDollar as a cross-chain stablecoin lending lego shares the same cross-chain vision with Kyber. xDollar was born on Polygon yet the journey isn’t done there and will eventually travel to other planets like AVAX, ETH, BSC, and others. As Kyber is launching on multiple planets (ETH, BSC, AVAX), xDollar will continue to partner with KyberDMM by encouraging xDollar users for liquidity stacking. Hence, this is a win-win proposal for both Kyber and xDollar communities to partner together on multiple chains for the long term.

As on Polygon, xDollar will maintain the minimum requirement of $200,000 worth of liquidity on an existing amplified xUSD-USDC (AMP=32) pool on KyberDMM. As on AVAX, xDollar will also plan to launch the minimum requirement of $200,000 worth of liquidity on a new amplified xUSD-DAI (AMP=32) pool on KyberDMM. Together with requested KNC rewards, total incentives exceed the minimum requirement of $200,000.

We propose this campaign be executed into two phases because xDollar is planning to upgrade its platform in late Q3 & early Q4. There is a transition period for xDollar v1 to xDollar v2.

### Motivation, and Key Details

Step Hero is proposing a joint liquidity mining program with Kyber to help improve liquidity for the HERO token on Binance Smart Chain (BSC).
Liquidity providers who add liquidity to the eligible HERO pool on BSC will enjoy high capital efficiency and receive LP tokens that can be staked on the Yield page for additional KNC and HERO token rewards.

Our visions are to bring users the most novelistic gaming experience and the most lucrative earning opportunities while promoting the expansion of the BSC & Polygon ecosystems and the mass adoption of blockchain applications. More than that, we target to become one of the leading NFT ecosystems in the blockchain space.

Our team has more than 50 members with impressive backgrounds in different fields. We’re game-lovers with the desire to recreate legendary characters of their childhood game in real life aligning with the 4.0 technology trend. Step Hero team took time to thoroughly study each character and create a creative NFT project, including a high liquidity marketplace and RPG game. Step Hero is the result of a proper working spirit. Our team’s ambition is to make Step Hero the best NFT game in the market.
